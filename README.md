# SLICE GMOD
GMOD - Partially mesh slice weapon

This is a Garry's Mod slicer weapon partial implementation. Select the weapon on the menu, then click on any entity to slice the physics object mesh (server-side only). Until Garry's Mod have a method to modify the model's meshes on the client-side, this may be used for study purposes.
